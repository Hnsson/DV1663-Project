## Introduction
A social media web application that is accessed through SSO api. The posts are associated with the id retrieved through the API. The Users can read, write, update, and delete.

### Problem It Solves
The problem this web application solves is the frustration of a login barrier that various
platforms use with different usernames and passwords for each platform the user has to
remember for it to be secured. Our project addresses this issue by providing a seamless
SSO solution, allowing effortless access to their favorite posts and content on the site.
Students will be able to build a community and potentially improve the student life here at
school. It will not be only for social events but also for anything else that relates to students
in general here at BTH. Currently the largest communication channel for students at BTH is
a facebook group, and not everyone uses facebook.

### Targeted Audience
Students at BTH that are able to post about upcoming events or activities that might interest
other fellow students. The students will be able to interact and build a sort of community.
And with SSO, it helps with the inconvenience of managing numerous login credentials
across different platforms

### Why the idea is a good fit for the audience and the problem
Almost everyone has a google or outlook account, and this platform will be simpler to use as
well as improve the ability for students to reach out to each other. It would also be easier for
new students to join the community and potentially find friends or study buddies. Older
students would be able to help newer students with questions that they might be lingering on
but have not asked before as they did not know where to turn to or they were too shy.
Students will be able to ask questions or post anonymously.

### Main features that application will have on completion
The main functionality of this application to solve the problems are consists of the following
features:
- Sorting newest/oldest posts etc (store timestamp of publication) This will check lot of
queries due to being able to sort by numerous ways, by friends, by timestamps, (by
tags: I want to see dog related posts)? Will require a lot of joining tables and so on.
- Create and manage discussion threads as well as posts which can be liked by users
- Anonymous discussions/questions.
- Student discussions, events, what is currently happening at school, questions
etc.
- Create events that people can join.

The source of the data is generated and collected by users during usage which will populate
the database.
